Description: 
    The main functions in this package are with_cache() and cached_read(). 
    The former is a simple way to cache an R object into a file on disk, 
    using 'cachem'. The latter is a wrapper around any standard read function, 
    but caches both the output and the file list info. If the input file list
    info hasn't changed, the cache is used; otherwise, the original files are
    re-read. This can save time if the original operation requires reading from
    many files, and/or involves lots of processing.
